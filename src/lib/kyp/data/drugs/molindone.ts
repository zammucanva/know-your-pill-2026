  summary: "Molindone is a dihydroindolone antipsychotic with a standard high-potency D2 profile except for one pharmacological novelty: it is the antipsychotic associated with weight loss rather than gain. Clinically superseded, it survives in exam lore and occasional adolescent use as the 'anti-metabolic typical' — a useful counter-example in a class defined by weight gain.",

Like most psychotropic medications, the full benefit builds gradually — some symptoms (sleep, energy, appetite) may improve before the main target symptoms respond. Do not stop early because you don't feel immediate effects.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the most common side effects of Molindone?",
      answer: "The most frequently reported effects are: Extrapyramidal symptoms (parkinsonism), Akathisia, Hyperprolactinaemia, Sedation, Weight loss / anorexia. Most of these appear in the first week or two and settle as your body adjusts. Tell your doctor about any side effect that persists or worries you.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I stop Molindone suddenly?",
      answer: "No — taper gradually under medical supervision rather than stopping abruptly. Abrupt discontinuation can cause withdrawal-like symptoms and risk symptom relapse. Always discuss the plan with your doctor first.",
    },
    {
      question: "What should I do if I miss a dose?",
      answer: "Take it as soon as you remember unless it is nearly time for your next dose — in that case, skip the missed dose. Never take a double dose to make up for a missed one.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is Molindone habit-forming?",
      answer: "Not considered habit-forming.. However, every patient should take Molindone exactly as prescribed and never change the dose without medical advice.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I take Molindone during pregnancy or breastfeeding?",
      answer: "Discuss this with your doctor before becoming pregnant if possible. Decisions depend on balancing the risk of untreated illness against medication exposure — Molindone may be continued, switched, or tapered depending on your situation. Never stop abruptly on your own.",

    summary: "Molindone is a prescription medicine used to treat schizophrenia — psychotic manifestations. It belongs to a well-studied class of medicines and works gradually — most people notice the benefit over weeks, not days.",
    mechanism: "Molindone is an older antipsychotic with one unusual feature: instead of the weight gain that similar medicines cause, it tends to reduce appetite. Otherwise it behaves like other strong older antipsychotics, with stiffness and restlessness as its main effects.",
    sideEffects: "The most common side effects are: extrapyramidal symptoms (parkinsonism), akathisia, hyperprolactinaemia, sedation, weight loss / anorexia. These usually appear early and many settle with time. Serious effects are uncommon but important to know: Neuroleptic malignant syndrome and Tardive dyskinesia. Contact your doctor urgently if you experience these. Tell your doctor about any effect that persists or worries you — there is almost always a solution.",
    monitoring: "Your doctor will monitor: weight and bmi (baseline, then periodically); aims examination (baseline, then every 6 months); eps screen (parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia) (every review in the first 2 months). Keep every appointment — these checks are how the treatment stays safe.",
    contraindications: "Do not take this medicine if: you have a known allergy to it. Always share your full medical history and medicine list with your doctor.",
    interactions: "Tell your doctor and pharmacist about everything you take — including over-the-counter and herbal products. Common interacting agents include: QT-prolonging drugs (including other antipsychotics), Anticholinergic drugs, CNS depressants and alcohol. Avoid alcohol unless your doctor says it is safe.",
